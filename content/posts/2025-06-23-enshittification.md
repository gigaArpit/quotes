"Enshittification" refers to the decline in quality of online platforms and
services over time, often due to a shift in focus from user experience to
profit maximization.

Initially, platforms attract users with appealing features and a good
experience, but as they mature, they introduce more advertisements, higher
costs, or less useful features, ultimately making the platform less
enjoyable for users.
