To live fully is to act with the awareness of death and the humility of
ignorance. Living as if tomorrow may not come compels clarity,
decisiveness, and the rejection of triviality.

Yet learning as if life is endless anchors us in curiosity, patience, and
the long view. One without the other leads to imbalance: *urgency without
growth burns out*; endless preparation without action stagnates. Together,
they form a discipline, act with intensity, learn with permanence.

> Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live
forever.
 ~ Gandhi
