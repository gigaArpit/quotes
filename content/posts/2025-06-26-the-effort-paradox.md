The more effortless something looks, the more effort was put in to look
that way.

Whether you're an athlete, artist, entrepreneur, or blend of all three.
It's the work you do in the dark - the empty gyms, early mornings, and
unseen reps - that allows you to shine in the light.

As the saying goes, "You earn your trophies at practice, you just pick them
up at competitions."
