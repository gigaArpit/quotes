You will not be rescued. No one is coming to tell you when to start or what
path to take. The discomfort you feel is not a signal to retreat but a call
to advance. Every excuse you craft is a brick in the wall you’re building
against yourself. Tear it down. Work when it’s boring. Act when you’re
uncertain. You are not waiting on potential—you are wasting it. What
matters is not inspiration but repetition. Get up. Move forward. Make
progress unglorified, unnoticed, unrelenting.

Where are you still waiting for permission instead of moving with purpose?
What lies have you accepted about your limits that deserve to be tested now?
