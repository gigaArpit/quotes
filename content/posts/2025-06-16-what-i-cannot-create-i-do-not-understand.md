Creation is the ultimate test of comprehension. To replicate or build a
thing, whether physical, conceptual, or systemic, is to reveal its
structure, dependencies, and dynamics.

If I cannot construct it from first principles, I do not possess true
understanding. What remains is surface familiarity or pattern mimicry.

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.
